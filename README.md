# Crowd Simulation Engine

## Intro
ECMGenerator is a crowd simulation engine, built in C++17. The focus lies on achieving real-time, large-scale crowd
simulations. The basis of the crowd simulator lies in the Explicit Corridor Map (ECM) navigation mesh structure. More information on ECM:

## Features
- 2D agent-based simulation
- ORCA obstacle avoidance
- Create your own simulation environment using spawn-, goal- and obstacle areas.
- Data-oriented memory layout
- Designed for 20,000+ agents
